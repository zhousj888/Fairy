## About Fairy

Fairy is a script language specially used to write UI.
The syntax is mainly borrowed from SwiftUI.
There is only iOS virtual machine now.
I will add Android and JavaScript VM later when i am free.
Of course, it would be great if someone is willing to implement these virtual machines togetherüòÅ, MR is welcome.
The taget is that use one Fairy script renering UI on Android, iOS and Web.
